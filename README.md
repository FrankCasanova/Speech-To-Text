# Speech-To-Text

# Speech to Text & Text to Speech Application

This is a simple Python project that utilizes the `pyttsx3` and `speech_recognition` libraries to convert text to speech and recognize user speech, respectively.

## Functionality

The application consists of two main functions:

1. **Text to Speech (TTS):** Converts text to speech and plays the result through the system's speakers.

2. **Speech to Text (STT):** Listens to the user via the microphone and transcribes the speech into text, which is then saved in a file called `output.txt`.

## How to Use the Application

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-to-text-text-to-speech.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install SpeechRecognition
```
3. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
4. The application will prompt you to speak into the microphone. After speaking, the transcription will be displayed in the console and saved in the output.txt file
